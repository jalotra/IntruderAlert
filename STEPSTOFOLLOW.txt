1. Raspberry pi remains on all time if it has power input.
2. Pi Senses the surrounding and sends realtime video to a local server
   through websockets.
3. Also simultaneouly an opencv dnn is running in the background that senses 
   objects and captures photos using the opencvdnn.
4. Save the recognised person's photo in a separate folder. 
4. And uses Sendgrid API to send the photo with proper Subject and Body to 
   the owner of the house

LATER WHAT I CAN DO:
1. Use more than one PI and send collabprative videos in real-time.
2. Use Heroku server(A Linux Machine) to send the videos to that sever.
